## Overview
Beepboop is a Turing-complete programming language implemented in Rust, with all syntax elements made up of machine or robot noises. Code examples can be found in the `code` folder.

## Basics

Integer literals are created in a binary representation, where beep represents a 1 and boop represents zero. E.g. 13 could be represented as `beep beep boop beep`.

Variable assignment:

    whirr <var> <value>


If statement:

    bip <condition> <value_if_true> <value_if_false>

The `condition` can be either a boolean or a number (where 0 represents false, and anything else is true).

For loop:

    ratatat <n_loops> <body>
